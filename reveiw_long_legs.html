                    <h2>(Rated R) (Scary Level: 8)</h2>
                        <p>Long legs was a disturbing movie on my list. It begins by showing a little girl outside of a house
                            in the winter and a car driving up to the house with what appears to be no one in the driver’s seat.
                            Then there’s a man right in front of the girl. This starts off the movie with the audience asking a
                            lot of questions. Throughout the movie you will find a lot of suspense with a moderate level of
                            gore. There are also themes of dolls and satanism. This movie is not one you would want to
                            watch at night.
