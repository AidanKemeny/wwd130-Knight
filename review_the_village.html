                            The village is a milder movie for those who may be more sensitive, but still a very interesting
                            story with a big twist at the end. It takes place in a small village. The people there can’t leave
                            because the surrounding woods around them has a beast that will come for them if they cross a
                            certain line or are wearing a certain color. This is great movie for those who love M. Night
                            Shyamalan movies such as The Sixth Sense, Trap, Old, or unexpected twists.
