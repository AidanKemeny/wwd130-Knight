                    <h3>(Rated R) (Scary Level: 8)</h3>
                        <p>Long legs was a disturbing movie on my list. It begins by showing a little girl outside of a house
                            in the winter and a car driving up to the house with what appears to be no one in the driver’s seat.
                            Then there’s a man right in front of the girl. This starts off the movie with the audience asking a
                            lot of questions. Throughout the movie you will find a lot of suspense with a moderate level of
                            gore. There are also themes of dolls and satanism. This movie is not one you would want to
                            watch at night.

                    <h3>(Rated PG13) (Scary Level: 3)</h3>
                        <p>A Quiet Place is a more milder horror movie on my list. There isn’t too much gore or swearing.
    I                       t is a good movie to start with if you are very sensitive to horror.

                        <p>
                            The village is a milder movie for those who may be more sensitive, but still a very interesting
                            story with a big twist at the end. It takes place in a small village. The people there can’t leave
                            because the surrounding woods around them has a beast that will come for them if they cross a
                            certain line or are wearing a certain color. This is great movie for those who love M. Night
                            Shyamalan movies such as The Sixth Sense, Trap, Old, or unexpected twists.

                    <h3>(Rated R) (Scary Level: 7)</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is one of the classic slasher horror movies most are familiar with.

                    <h3>(Rated R) (Scary Level: 9)</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was genuinely scared watching this movie. You will be screaming at the characters for their
                            decisions almost all the way through, and the ending might make you mad. A group of girls
                            decide to venture down into a cave and are met with some interesting creatures, to say the least.
                            The feelings invoked felt like I was watching the movie Fall again. This movie is worth the
                            watch if you want to be scared at night and never go into a cave again.
